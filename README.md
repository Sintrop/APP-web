Sintrop app react front-end application


## Project introduction 
Our goal is to develop a software with the purpose of making agriculture sustainable in the world. We are bulding a community of people to fight against non agroecological agriculture pratctices. 

To understand better, read our _whitepaper_ before start contributing.
https://github.com/Sintrop/SDP/releases

It is imperative that all developers read this document before starting to participate.


## Getting Started

New contributors that want to fight for agroecology are very welcome and needed.
Before you start contributing, familiarize yourself with the Sintrop Sofware.


## Communication Channels
Our basic and daily discussions happens on discord.

Joins our community on discord:
https://discord.gg/mxb69HmFWn

Discussion about codebase improvements happens in GitHub issues and pull requests.

We have a development meeting every Monday at 7pm (GMT -3). At this meeting, the developers must present the code that has been developed to the rest of the team. PR will be discussed and new SIPs will be explained at this meeting. It is very important that contributors attend the meeting.

### Code standardization

It's imperative to develop test units

Clean code

## Commits and Pull Requests Rules

Commits standardization:

## How to run the project

after npm install, run the following command:
### `npm install --save-dev react-app-rewired crypto-browserify stream-browserify assert stream-http https-browserify os-browserify url buffer process`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Development server


### Deploying contracts

To communicate with our contracts, run the 'core-contracts' on your machine, deploy it using truffle-ganache and paste the ABIs on this front-end repository.


## DevelopersPool
We will update information about DevelopersPool here as soon as we publish it to mainnet.

### Applying for the pool
Developers that are contributing to the project will be approved to earn our tokens.
